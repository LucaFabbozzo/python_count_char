# 1. Remove withespace from a string and return a list with the remaining characters.(use list comprehension)
# 2. Count in a dictionary how many characters in a string are repeated
# 3. Sort the keys of a dictionary by their value and return a list containing tuples [("a", 3), ("b", 2),("c", 4), ("d", 4)]
# 4. from a list of tuples, return those with the highest value [("a", 3), ("b", 2),("c", 4), ("d", 4)] -> [("c", 4), ("d", 4)]
# 5. Create a message that says: The characters that are repeated the most with 4 repetitions are: - C / - D (these characters must be with a capital letter)
# 6. Combine the solution from the previous exercises to find the most repeated characters in a string
